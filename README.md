# Puppeteer Course

I want to learn:

- use of NPM
- test automation

## How to Install

```shell
npm install
```

> Because `package.json` includes dependencies, I do not have to specify all of them and just run `npm instll`.

```javascript
let name = "Olga"
```

## Handy Command Line (Terminal) Commands

```shell
rm file.ext  # delete file
cp file-source.ext file-destination.ext  # copy file-source.ext to file-destination.ext
pwd  # show current directory
ls  # list files in current directory
ls -alFG  # list files with extra information
cat file.ext  # show file contents
cd dir_name/  # change directory to dir_name/
cd ..  # change directory to parent
nano file.ext  # open file file.ext in Nano editor
touch file.ext  # create empty file.ext
chmod 777 file.ext  # change permissions for file to allow read, write and execute for all: user, group and other users
```
